                        After specialising in Ecommerce Strategies from Harvard University, Karan returned to India and set up IIDE. He identified global 
                        digital transformation as the future and recognised the lack of digitally skilled human resources as the need of the hour.
                         Hence, IIDE was born. <br> <br>
                        
                        Since then, IIDE’s efforts to bridge the digital skill gap has led to the upskilling of 2,35,000+ students and professionals 
                        via courses, webinars, seminars & workshops. IIDE has also trained leading corporations like Mahindra and Mahindra, Volkswagen, 
                        Asian Paints, Pfizer, Cipla, Estee Lauder, Leo Burnett, Publicis Worldwide and World Bank in Digital Skills. <br> <br>
                        
                        He is a visiting faculty at the IIMs and 14+ Mumbai University colleges. He is a frequent front-page writer for 
                        reputed publishings such as Education Times, Forbes, Youth Magazine, Business World etc. <br> <br>
                        
                        His belief is that digital skills are no longer a secondary skill but an absolute primary for a future proof career. <br>
